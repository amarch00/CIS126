                <h2>New Competitive Multiplayer</h2>
                <p>
                    The Crucible functions differently in Destiny 2. All game modes feature two teams of four for every game mode. In&hyphen;game, there is a new HUD that gives the player information on the enemy team, like when their Super is ready, or when and where they picked up ammo for their power weapons. There are also brand new maps and game modes. One of the new game modes, for example, is called Countdown, which is the first attack&hyphen;defend game mode in the Crucible, similar to Call of Duty&apos;s Search and Destroy. The radar is also modified, with the detection radius being fixed, as opposed to it scanning until it finds an enemy.<br><br>

                <p>
                    While Destiny 2&apos;s expansions have continued to expand the story, Bungie had begun a larger narrative epic with its seasonal content starting in Shadowkeep. During Shadowkeep, Eris Morn discovers one of the Pyramid-shaped ships buried beneath the surface of the Moon, and the Guardian encounters a voice from the Darkness, warning them of the fleet&apos;s imminient arrival within the system. The Vanguard deal with new threats from Hive and Vex forces loyal to the Darkness as the Pyramid fleet soon arrive in the System and take positions above Io, Titan, Mercury, and Mars. The Darkness attempt to communicate to Eris but are blocked by Savath没n. The Guardians are able to defeat Savath没n&apos;s forces, giving the Darkness the opportunity to alert them to a new power awaiting them on Europa. Meanwhile, the Vanguard evacuate their forces from those planets occupied by the Darkness before they are engulfed by a strange force that vanishes them, although Commander Sloan and Asher Mir elect to stay behind, while Brother Vance enters the Infinite Forest on Mercury. The Traveler reacts to this and fully reforms itself just as all the Guardians had returned to the Last City to shelter under its Light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Beyond Light, the Vanguard continue to find signs of the Darkness pyramids across the system. On Europa, the Guardians accept the power of Stasis from the Darkness to defeat one of the Fallen Houses that had also learned to use Stasis. Zavala and other members of the Vanguard are concerned about the use of the powers of Darkness but recognize that it is an effective weapon against forces of humanity. The Vanguard make alliances with the Cabal and one of the Fallen Houses as they recognize they face a common threat from the Hive, Taken, and Vex.
                    The Witch Queen focuses on the Hive god and Oryx&apos;s sister Savath没n, who has obtained the power of the Light and gifted it to her soldiers &lpar;known as the Lucent Brood&rpar;. Taking place in a new area, Savath没n&apos;s Throne World within the Ascendant Realm, Guardians will fight off the Hive who have obtained the Light and take it back while evading her schemes.
