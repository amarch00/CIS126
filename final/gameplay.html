                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to its predecessor, Destiny 2 is a first&ndash;person shooter game that incorporates role&ndash;playing and massively multiplayer online game &lpar;MMO&rpar; elements. The original Destiny includes on&ndash;the&ndash;fly matchmaking that allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were &quot;matched&quot; by the game. 
                    To communicate with other players in the game world, players had to use their respective console's messaging system. Destiny 2 features a more optimal way of matchmaking called &quot;Guided Games&quot;, which allows players to search for clans who may need additional players for activities, such as &quot;strikes&quot;, dungeons, or raids. 
                    Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus environment &lpar;PvE&rpar; and player versus player &lpar;PvP&rpar; game types.
                </p>
                <h2>Character progression</h2>
                <p>
                    As in the original game, players are able to improve their characters, referred to as Guardians, by gaining experience points &lpar;EXP&rpar; &mdash; when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will level up and gain improved statistics which further enhance performance in battle. 
                    As of the Shadowkeep expansion, this leveling system has since been replaced with the &quot;season pass&quot; system where players use EXP to &quot;rank up&quot;, which rewards different items each rank &lpar;while there is no max rank on a season pass, seasonal rewards end at level 100&rpar;. 
                    Quests, including the &quot;main scenario&quot; quests, are specific tasks given to the player by non&ndash;player characters &lpar;NPCs&rpar; which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario quest lines progresses the overarching plot of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon reaching the character EXP level cap &lpar;level 20 at launch, expanded to 50&rpar;, character progression shifts to improving their &quot;Power&quot; level &lpar;formerly &quot;Light&quot; level&rpar; by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources, including &quot;strikes&quot;, dungeons, or raids, and in&ndash;game events. 
                    The three weapon classes and five pieces of armor each have a Power level; a character's Power level is the average of that gear. A higher character level allows for better equipment with higher Power levels to be equipped. A higher Power level improves damage output and defense. 
                    A soft and hard Power level exists for gear which is incremented with each additional expansion or season; players can earn gear up to the soft Power level through most regular activities, but must participate in more challenging events, like Nightfall strikes, dungeons, or raids, to earn pinnacle gear to reach the hard Power level. 
                    Gear can be infused with unwanted gear of higher Power level to increase its Power level for the cost of in&ndash;game resources.

                <p>
                    Rarity indicates the quality of a particular item, such as a weapon, armor piece, ghost shell, sparrow, ship, emblem, or shader. There are five levels of rarity, each distinguishable by the color of the item icon background&colon;
